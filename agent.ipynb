However, I can suggest some ways for you to check the current weather in San Francisco:\\n\\n1. **Check online weather websites**: You can visit websites like AccuWeather, Weather.com, or the National Weather Service (NWS) for up-to-date information on San Francisco's weather.\\n2. **Use a mobile app**: Download a weather app on your smartphone, such as Dark Sky or Weather Underground, to get real-time weather updates for San Francisco.\\n\\nThat being said, I can give you some general information about San Francisco's climate:\\n\\n* **Temperature:** Daytime temperatures in San Francisco typically range from the mid-60s to low 70s Fahrenheit (18-22°C) during the summer months and around 50°F (10°C) during the winter months.\\n* **Fog:** San Francisco is known for its fog, especially during the summer months when a layer of cool air settles over the city. The fog typically clears up by mid-morning.\\n* **Rainfall:** San Francisco receives most of its rainfall between November and March, with an average annual rainfall of around 20 inches (508 mm).\\n\\nIf you're planning to visit or live in San Francisco, I recommend checking the current weather forecast for a more accurate picture.\"}"
